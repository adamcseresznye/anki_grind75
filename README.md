# Anki Deck to *schedule* Leetcode Grind 75 problems

This repository contains an Anki deck specifically designed to help you schedule and memorize Leetcode problems. The idea for this deck was heavily inspired by a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1iep67l/memorising_leetcode_by_using_anki_as_a_scheduler/) and [Skerritt's blog post](https://skerritt.blog/memorising-leetcode-by-using-anki-as-a-scheduler/), which mentioned using Anki as a **scheduler** to practice Leetcode problems.

In the referenced blog post, an Anki deck containing questions from the "Netcode 150" was provided. However, if you're short on time or want a more focused selection of problems, the **Grind 75** deck may be more suitable.

## Whatâ€™s Included
- **Anki Deck**: The actual Anki deck that you can import and start using right away.
- **CSV File**: A customizable CSV file with the list of Leetcode problems, which you can modify based on your preferences.

## Anki Settings Used (from the blog post)
Feel free to adjust the settings according to your needs, but these are the ones I personally use to schedule the problems effectively.
